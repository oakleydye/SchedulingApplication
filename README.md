Software II Performance Assessment - this application is designed to
schedule and manage appointments with clients for a company.  

**Version Info**  
Application version 1.0.072  
Developed in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2020.2.2  
Using JDK 11.0.8 and JavaFX SDK 11.0.2

**Testing instructions**  
All the build configurations should be set up if using IntelliJ. 
Once building the app, you will see a login screen. 
Enter the username 'test' and password 'test' to be allowed in. 
Once you are in the app, you will see a grid with all existing appointments
and fields to update or create appointments. You can click on the button
'Manage Customers' to edit, view, and add customers. There are also
buttons across the bottom of the app that will generate the required
reports.  
NOTE: The form that displays details about the appointment on the right-hand 
side of the screen is also the form used to create and modify
appointments. Clicking the 'Add New Appointment' button only clears out
the form so that a new one can be added. Once you have input all 
necessary information into the form, you will need to click 'Save', NOT
'Add New Appointment'. To modify an appointment, select the appointment
in the grid, and the data will auto-populate into the form. Make necessary changes
and click 'Save'. This same process should be used when adding and
modifying customers.

**Report Description**  
The additional report added to the application is actually 
a directory of contacts. This report is designed to be used by 
employees to see all contacts that the organization has in the 
database.
